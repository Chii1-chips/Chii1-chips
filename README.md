😽  ── .✦ ;; I am Chii, but you can basically call me anything! Nicknames, or any cosplays I wear in games, especially Pony Town. I have been playing Pony Town since around 2021-2022 (Somewhere between that range of years).
Also, if you want, you can call me Elliot! Chii or Elliot, I love both. ^_^

😾 (1) (⇀‸↼‶) ;; So.. You read that correctly. Firstly. PLEASE DO NOT, and when i mean it, DO NOT CALL ME she/her pronouns! I only ACCEPT these pronouns if I'm ROLEPLAYING as a character that uses them. I get extremely uncomfortable if used in any other situation. PLEASE only call me by he/him pronouns ONLY!! I appericate if you'd respect this. It's fine if you don't know this at first, (When we first meet). 

## 😾 (2) ( ˶°ㅁ°) !! ;; Also, please do not joke about su1c!de infront of me. As someone who has went through that heavily, I'd appericate if you talk about it PRIVATELY or in a serious manner. Please read the second half of the things I'm okay with to learn more about what I'm comfortable with during this.

😺 (1) (˶ˆᗜˆ˵) ;; Though, here are some I am fine with as long with permission! C+H. As long as I have C+H in my name, you're free to do those things! But, please, if I don't have them in my name, then, ask. 

🐱 (2) ( · ❛ ֊ ❛) ;; Here's another thing I'm okay with! Interacting with me. I'm pretty open to chat for any means, but I'm quite shy and can get nervous easily if I don't known someone well. So, please, understand that. Though, I'm not the best at comforting or doing advise during times of venting, but i'll always try my best. BUT, You can only vent to me if you're a close friend of mine, or an IRL friend of mine. I generally get a bit uncomfortable when a random stranger vents to me, because- I just don't know them.

🐱 (3) (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞ ;; Of course, for ships, it's totally cool! I don't ship too many characters, but you can always ask. just as long as you're a friend of mine! Close friends are always allowed as so, but just ask b4 doing so- and same goes w/ matching skins in PT. Just ask me, but as long as your a friend of mine.

 - Baby boy/girl (Erm, no. Unless you're a really close friend of mine!)
 - Any 'feminine' nicknames like wife... (NO. Huge NO. Unless you're my CLOSE friend.)
 - Any cosplay names (Unless I'm wearing that cosplay, then dont call me it. Just call me Chii or Chii Chii.)
 - If you want to call me a nickname, please ask if so. Dont use it randomly on me. Especially if you're someone I JUST met.
 - ... That's all I can think of. My brain shortcircuted. Soz.

# Some more important stuff.

## 😿 - My mental isn't the greatest, nor will I always be in a happy mood all the time. of course, I can't always change my pfp, blah, blah, blah into something sad, so it'll just.. stay inactive. If I'm inactive for a super long time (like one-two-ish weeks) then i'm struggling heavy. I am a pretty regular online person. Sometimes, I will take breaks. I have been through alot of heavy things for myself. And, I hope you, stranger, or friend can understand this.
## Most importantly, I WILL MOST LIKELY NOT BE RESPONDING TO MESSAGES AT ALL DURING THESE TIMES. IF YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND, OR SOMEONE I KNOW, THEN YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON WITH ME. I AM ONLY COMFORTABLE SHARING SENSITIVE INFORMATION TO PEOPLE THAT I KNOW, OR TRUST VERY WELL. IF YOU ARE NOT SOMEONE I KNOW, THEN PLEASE DO NOT ASK ME MY STATE OF MENTAL. THAT IS ONLY FOR CLOSE FRIENDS TO KNOW ONLY. I DO NOT CARE THAT IT MAY JUST BE CONCERN, IT IS MY INFORMATION TO SHARE TO THOSE I TRUST THE MOST IN THESE SITUATIONS.

## If I ever become snappy or angry, then please understand it's because of my mental state that is swishy (Mainly horrible but its getting a little better now). I don't mean anything when im angry or upset, because my emotions are spiked up to the max. if you ever come across this time, please just understand this fact. I apologize in advance.

- ༄˖°.🍋.ೃ࿔*:･ ~ ;; Lemon Cookie x  Big Shot Spamton (CROB + Deltarune || (This is a crackship, not really that serious of a ship I like a little hehe.)
- . ₊˚ ☎︎₊˚✧ ~ ;;  007n7 x Spamton (Forsaken verison + Deltarune) || (This is also another crackship, not a serious one. Just for the sillies, but i like it a bit.)

(╭ರ_•́) - ;; Also, if you don't know the term of what a "crackship" is, it's like two characters from completely different fandoms paired together, unlikely to even LOVE each other at all in two different COMPLETE fandoms.. It can just be shortened to- "I wanna ship it because I find it funny". Or it can just be characters who met just ever so briefly. Kinda just like for the giggles.

Anyway.

- A slight dummy at jokes and stuff. My humor is just being stupid af and dry-like humor. I can be slightly sarcastic, because I can take things that are just metaphorically more seriously than they were meant to be. I apologize in advance! (⸝⸝๑﹏๑⸝⸝)
- I can be a slight freak if you get to know me really well, so if that makes you uncomfortable, don't be afraid to say it. I'm always sorry if I make you uncomfortable! Sometimes I can't get these on the first try.

# (You may skip this part if you not one of the people I mentioned) A Special Thank you to these people. (Is this too early to say?)

# Gunner - Though we may have seperated, you were the person that taught me that life was more than it seemed.

# Badger - My first friend. I have a ton to say about you. We may not ever see each other again, but you sharing your struggles with me, and us connecting helped me live just a little longer. I endear the times you helped make me the Fox Care place, even if it is discontinued, you have a special place in my heart. Badger, if you ever say this, PLEASE never give up. I waited for a long time for you to come back, and i'll wait even longer if it means I'll get a single message of you on nintendo.

# Cosmo - You were one of the first few friends that, even if unknowingly had stopped me from attempting. I love the ocs we've made. Fez, Lpurple... I appericate everything you do. Your jokes. Your laughter. Our voicecalls. I will forever love our friendship until the ends of this earth.

# Ayumi - I'm so gald you're there for me even when i don't share my struggles. I love your personaility, and art. Not to add, I'm going to eat all of your art. yea. I also like times we hangout on Pony Town, and the silly moments we share. That was always the neatest parts of our friendship between us.

# Cyn - You were one of the first few friends to make me feel really appericated. I can't help but express my endearment to you. I rememeber the times we roleplayed, the chatter, the times in Pony Town, when i first experienced what friendship was truly like.

# Shiloh - Despite us seperating for sometime, and our differences, I'm gald that you're still in my life. You encouraged me to keep playing a game I was loosing hope to do. You cheered up my day even by your texts, and humor of yours.

# Hero - Even though we chat so randomly, I always liked how you were never afraid to show yourself and OCS. Sometimes, even the roleplays you randomly decide to do. Even If I can't understand what you mean sometimes, it's always a great time to have a chat with you.

# The Sorrowful One - I always like chatting with you, no matter what happens. Everyday, I await for maybe a response or text incoming.. Even with our short messages, its always fun to have a little bit of brightness in my life.

# BananaMT - Even if we barely chat, I remember the YS, the first time meeting you. Even if we didnt share the same fandoms, I always like the discord server you invited me in. Though, even if our conversations are a little dumb, I still get fond when i think of our past memories in Pony Town.

Thank you to all the people mentioned. For making me continue life as it was, for making me laugh, for making the light shine brighter than it ever was.
