😽  ── .✦ ;; I am Chii, but you can basically call me anything! Nicknames, or any cosplays I wear in games, especially Pony Town. I have been playing Pony Town since around 2021-2022 (Somewhere between that range of years). This will kind of just be a big yap session because I have alot to share about myself! :]

😾 (1) (⇀‸↼‶) ;; So.. You read that correctly. Firstly. PLEASE DO NOT, and when i mean it, DO NOT CALL ME she/her pronouns! I only ACCEPT these pronouns if I'm ROLEPLAYING as a character that uses them. I get extremely uncomfortable if used in any other situation. PLEASE only call me by they/them OR /he/him pronouns. I appericate if you'd respect this. It's fine if you don't know this at first, (When we first meet). 

😾 (2) ( ˶°ㅁ°) !! ;; Also, please do not joke about su1c!de infront of me. As someone who has went through that heavily, I'd appericate if you talk about it PRIVATELY or in a serious manner. Please read the second half of the things I'm okay with to learn more about what I'm comfortable with during this.

😺 (1) (˶ˆᗜˆ˵) ;; Though, here are some I am fine with as long with permission! C+H. As long as I have C+H in my name, you're free to do those things! But, please, if I don't have them in my name, then, ask. 

🐱 (2) ( · ❛ ֊ ❛) ;; Here's another thing I'm okay with! Interacting with me. I'm pretty open to chat for any means, but I'm quite shy and can get nervous easily if I don't known someone well. So, please, understand that. Though, I'm not the best at comforting or doing advise during times of venting, but i'll always try my best. BUT, You can only vent to me if you're a close friend of mine, or an IRL friend of mine. I generally get a bit uncomfortable when a random stranger vents to me, because- I just don't know them.

🐱 (3) (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞ ;; Of course, for ships, it's totally cool! I don't ship too many characters, but you can always ask. just as long as you're a friend of mine! Close friends are always allowed as so, but just ask b4 doing so- and same goes w/ matching skins in PT. Just ask me, but as long as your a friend of mine.

- ༄˖°.🍋.ೃ࿔*:･ ~ ;; Lemon Cookie x  Big Shot Spamton (CROB + Deltarune || (This is a crackship, not really that serious of a ship I like a little hehe.)
- . ₊˚ ☎︎₊˚✧ ~ ;;  007n7 x Spamton (Forsaken verison + Deltarune) || (This is also another crackship, not a serious one. Just for the sillies, but i like it a bit.)

(╭ರ_•́) - ;; Also, if you don't know the term of what a "crackship" is, it's like two characters from completely different fandoms paired together, unlikely to even LOVE each other at all in two different COMPLETE fandoms.. It can just be shortened to- "I wanna ship it because I find it funny". Or it can just be characters who met just ever so briefly. Kinda just like for the giggles.

# °‧ 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 ·｡ WIP. Uh. Yeah. this is an on-going wip. (˶•𐃷•˶)... runs away and scours to finish it someday else °‧ 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 ·｡
